## About Me :memo:

Hey there, fellow travelers of the digital realm! :computer: I'm Guts, a relentless warrior wandering through the vast landscapes of code and creativity. Much like the protagonist of Berserk, I thrive in the face of adversity, overcoming challenges with unwavering determination.

## Skills :muscle:

- **Swordsmanship**: Just as Guts wields his massive sword, Dragonslayer, I skillfully navigate through code, cutting through bugs and obstacles with precision and efficiency.
  
- **Resilience**: Like Guts, I persevere through tough times, learning from each battle and emerging stronger than before.
  
- **Adaptability**: Whether it's adapting to new technologies or facing unexpected twists in the project, I'm always ready to adjust my strategies on the fly.

## Projects :hammer_and_pick:

Here are some of the legendary quests I've embarked upon:

- **Tavern**: Tavern buy the food lol? [Check it out](https://www.github.com/Cruugo/tavern)

## Interests :scroll:

- **Dark Fantasy**: Just as Berserk immerses readers in a dark and gritty world, I'm drawn to exploring the depths of dark fantasy literature and art.
  
- **Medieval Warfare**: I find inspiration in the tactics and strategies of medieval warfare, much like the battles depicted in the Berserk manga.
  
- **Digital Art**: When not swinging swords in the digital realm, I wield the digital brush to create my own epic sagas through digital art.

- **Chinese Warfare**: China's history is an extremely long one and each time period and dynasty saw its own practices and innovations in warfare. Still, some themes run through the history of warfare in China. Officers were often professionals (although they commonly inherited their status), ordinary troops were conscripts or captured soldiers; convicts could also be pressed into service. There were also volunteers, typically young men from noble families who joined as cavalrymen looking for adventure and glory. The organisation of an army in the field into three divisions had a long tradition. So, too, did the five-man unit, typically applied to infantry where squads were composed of two archers and three spearmen. By the Warring States period, an army was typically divided into five divisions, each represented by a flag which denoted its function:

    Red Bird - Vanguard
    Green Dragon - Left Wing
    White Tiger - Right Wing
    Black Tortoise - Rear Guard
    Great Bear Constellation - Commander & Bodyguard

When the crossbow became more common troops proficient with that weapon often formed an elite corps and other specific units were used as shock troops to help out where needed or confuse the enemy. As already noted above, archers and cavalry protected the flanks of heavier infantry and chariots, when used, could fulfill the same function or bring up the rear. Such positions, which are described as ideals in the military treatises, are confirmed by the Terracotta Army of Shi Huangti. Flags, unit banners, drums and bells were used on the battlefield to better organise troops and deploy them in the manner the commander wished.
